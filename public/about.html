<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a professional, I am curious, tolerant, responsible, motivated, open-minded, and goal-driven. These qualities enable me to build strong and mutually beneficial relationships with clients and colleagues.
  <br /> 
I work as a Senior Research Analyst at Capestart, where I provide internal data issue support for CISION, a global earned media software company. I’ve discovered that I truly enjoy interacting with, troubleshooting, assisting, and supporting people with data issues, especially as I regularly collaborate with clients from different parts of the world.</p>


<p>I believe in continuous learning and make it a point to expand my knowledge daily—one concept a day adds up to 365 concepts in a year. My enthusiasm for cybersecurity drives much of my learning, alongside a focus on cloud computing with AWS and Azure.</p>
